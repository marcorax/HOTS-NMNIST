# HOTS-NMNIST

This project is a simple implementation of HOTS: 
https://www.neuromorphic-vision.com/public/publications/1/publication.pdf
meant to be used with the N-MNIST dataset.
The dataset is not included and a matlab script is included to create a more manageable single .mat file for train and test set.
The file is the N-MNIST\saveforpy.m dataset and it is meant to work with the script stabilize.m copied from the original N-MNIST project.
